# Dance for Justice

Our **parties** are more than just a celebration of movement — they are a statement for safety and inclusion. Through the vibrant, inclusive energy of Fusion dance, we create space where bodies are celebrated, boundaries are respected, and community thrives in safety and solidarity.

We dance in **protest of rape culture** - a culture that normalizes violence, silences survivors, and devalues consent. We reject the myths, the silence, and the systems that perpetuate sexual harm. In their place, we move with intention, with joy, and with fierce compassion.

This gathering is also a **fundraiser**: all proceeds go directly to organizations working to end sexual violence and support survivors. Every beat, every step, and every connection on the dance floor fuels that mission. Together, we embody a future where consent is culture, accountability is the norm, and everyone has the right to move freely without fear.

We are not fighting any individual, but a system. Anyone can join as long as they share those values.

We dance not just for ourselves — but for the world we are building.
