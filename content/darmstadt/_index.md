# Darmstadt

The Darmstadt Fusion scene is still in its infancy, but there are occasional social dances hosted by a small group of local dancers.
If you want to reach out to the Darmstadt organisers, send an email to DA.fusion[at]posteo.de

Make sure to check out the Fusion socials in neighbouring cities like [Frankfurt](/frankfurt), [Heidelberg](/heidelberg) or [Stuttgart](/stuttgart).
You can also see all of their events in the [Rhein-Main-Neckar](/rhein-main-neckar) region.

## Code of Conduct

We invite you to dance and spend time with us. For this, we would like to share some aspects to help you figure out what to expect, and create a support structure for navigating our space together. We also want to share some of our ideas for the dances more explicitly.

### General
First and foremost, we would like to encourage everyone to approach each other with an open heart, empathy, and assume positive intentions. We invite everybody to treat others with respect, regardless of age, appearance, dance ability, disability, ethnicity, gender, preferences, and sexual orientation. Addressing participants with the name and pronouns they provide and more generally checking in about our preferences is something close to our heart.  
Please look after your own and others' well-being, which includes keeping up with personal hygiene, reducing odours (natural and artificial), watching out for your energy level and being mindful about your capacities when consuming alcohol.

### Consent
Consent practices are important to us, both on and off the dance floor. We encourage everyone to practice verbal and non-verbal consent – if in doubt, please ask with words. We encourage everyone to stand up for themselves and their boundaries. We ask you to listen closely to each other to understand and honour each other’s wishes. Reminder: You have permission to speak up, step away and revoke your consent at any time.

### Dancing
On the social dance floor we invite everyone to mind their defaults that they bring along from their (dance) communities (e.g. close embrace, cuddles, dance roles, dips, head movements, leading legs) and check in about them with others. We consider it to be perfectly fine for anyone to decline a dance invitation without explanation or end a dance at any time. Due to the limited space, we ask everyone to abstain from aerials on the social dance floor.

### Conflicts
In case conflicts arise, our wish is for everyone to demonstrate a cooperative attitude and consideration for compromise. Especially in case someone asks you to adjust your behaviour, we ask you to listen closely to understand and honour the wishes of others. While we would like to empower everyone to address issues directly with each other, we also offer support in the form of a care team of volunteers to help with moderating conflicts to the best of their capacity. Beware, we – the organisers – can ask anyone to leave without a refund in case necessary.

### Music
We want to be friendly to our ears and therefore aim to limit the volume level to around 83 dB, which we might adapt slightly at the venue depending on the actual room acoustics. To support and enable this, we encourage everyone to snap their fingers instead of clapping to show their appreciation and talk at lower volumes for extended conversations.

### Pictures
While we appreciate visual memories in the form of pictures or videos, we ask everyone to make sure they have the explicit verbal consent of the depicted folks before sharing any of them outside the group.
